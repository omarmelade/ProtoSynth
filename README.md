# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarmelade/ProtoSynth/main/proto_synth.png" width="64">  Proto Synth v1.0.1 has arrived !

Proto Synth is a basic list app with oscillator and audiostreams in c++. This app makes you able to play with somes notes the most relevant i think.
Of course you can play thoses notes, for now the list is locked to 8 but it's just because i have decided.

I'm really happy about making this but i hope this project will go further because at this point it's just a funny thing.
